### Quick Start

Run the following command to create a new project with Forge:

```bash
forge
```

If everything goes well, you should see the following output in your terminal: 

```bash
+—————+  The Blacksmith: 
| ^ u ^  Welcome to  Forge  v0.0.1, xxxxx!
+—————+
```

This is The blacksmith, the Forge's command line interface. It will help you to create, build and deploy your project.
Follow his instructions to create your first project the best possible way.
